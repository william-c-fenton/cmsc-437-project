# cmsc-437-project
Project for UMBC's CMSC 437 project with Jon Squire.

This is an exercise tracker application that integrates with a simple SQLite database that is created when you open the program if it  doesn't exist. 

The user will be able to add exercises that they do (e.g. bench press, squats, swimming laps, etc...).

The user will be able to add exercises they did on the current date, how much resistance was present, and how many repetitions were done. Once you are done with the day's exercises, press 'Done' and you will add these exercises and statistics to the current day in the database.
