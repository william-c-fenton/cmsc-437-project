# cmsc-437-project
Project for UMBC's CMSC 437 project with Jon Squire.

This is an exercise tracker application that integrates with a simple SQLite database (this can be created from the application if not existing).

The user will be able to add exercises that they do (e.g. bench press, squats, swimming laps, etc...).

The user will be able to add exercises they did on specific dates, how much resistance was present, and how many repetitions were done.
